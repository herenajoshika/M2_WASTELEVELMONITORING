# WASTE LEVEL MONITORING

## Abstract

The idea is simple and is driven by the fact that dustbins require very frequent cleaning, which is not always possible. This leads to unhealthy environment and spread of diseases. The aim is to accommodate more and get the dustbin cleaned timely using alert services. The term waste management usually relates to all kinds of waste, whether generated during the extraction of raw materials, the processing of raw materials into final products, the consumption of final products, or other human activities, including municipal, agricultural, and social like health care etc. There needs to be system that gives prior information of the filling of the bin that alerts the municipality so that they can clean the bin on time and safeguard the environment. To avoid all such situations we intend to propose a solution for this problem WASTE LEVEL MONITORING, which will inform that the Dustbin is full by the use light and Voice indication using buzzer so that no one will fill the waste further untill its cleaned and also the distance is sent through.In my Project the dustbin gives alert signal when the dustbin have distance to fill the wastes is about less than 6cm.Atmega328 is the microcontroller used in this system and the language used as a software in this embedded system is C language further the Atmega328 is connected with LCD display to show the status of the dustbin and the distance filled,Ultrasonic sensor which helps in finding the distance filled by sending a signal through trigpin and receiving through echo pin and by using the time taken by the echo pin to recieve the signal the distance is calculated,Buzzer and LED is connected which acts as alert signals to indicate when the dustbin is full and the distance is also send through USART which is a communication protocol which could be seen in serial monitor.
